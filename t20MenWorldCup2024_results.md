Background
----------

The [ICC Men's T20 World Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men%27s_T20_World_Cup "ICC Men's T20 World Cup") is a professional [T20I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20_International "Twenty20 International") tournament held between men's national cricket teams, organized by the [International Cricket Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Cricket_Council "International Cricket Council") (ICC). The tournament, now being held every two years, was first played in [2007](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_ICC_World_Twenty20 "2007 ICC World Twenty20") in [South Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa "South Africa").^[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_ICC_Men%27s_T20_World_Cup#cite_note-3)^ The last tournament held in [2022](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_ICC_Men%27s_T20_World_Cup "2022 ICC Men's T20 World Cup") in [Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia "Australia") was contested by 16 teams.^[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_ICC_Men%27s_T20_World_Cup#cite_note-4)^ The defending champions were [England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_cricket_team "England cricket team"), who defeated [Pakistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_national_cricket_team "Pakistan national cricket team") in the final of the [previous edition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_ICC_Men%27s_T20_World_Cup "2022 ICC Men's T20 World Cup").^[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_ICC_Men%27s_T20_World_Cup#cite_note-5)^

### Host selection

In November 2021, the ICC announced that the 2024 Men's T20 World Cup would be played in the United States and the West Indies.^[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_ICC_Men%27s_T20_World_Cup#cite_note-6)^ A joint bid was submitted by [Cricket West Indies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_West_Indies "Cricket West Indies") and [USA Cricket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Cricket "USA Cricket") following two years of preparation, forming part of a strategic partnership between the two associations.^[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_ICC_Men%27s_T20_World_Cup#cite_note-7)^

USA Cricket's co-hosting was part of efforts to help develop and promote cricket in the United States, where the sport's fanbase is primarily made up of [South Asian Americans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asian_Americans "South Asian Americans"). Prior to this World Cup, the United States had occasionally hosted West Indies home matches at [Central Broward Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Broward_Park "Central Broward Park") in Florida, while a T20 franchise league known as [Major League Cricket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Cricket "Major League Cricket") launched in 2023.^[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_ICC_Men%27s_T20_World_Cup#cite_note-8)^^[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_ICC_Men%27s_T20_World_Cup#cite_note-:0-9)^^[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_ICC_Men%27s_T20_World_Cup#cite_note-:1-10)^

Although cricket had never become mainstream in the country, the United States is associated with several notable developments in the early history of the game, including having hosted [Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada "Canada") in the [first international cricket match](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_cricket_team_in_the_United_States_in_1844 "Canadian cricket team in the United States in 1844"), and American cricketer [Bart King](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bart_King "Bart King") having been credited with developing the technique of [swing bowling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_bowling "Swing bowling").^[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_ICC_Men%27s_T20_World_Cup#cite_note-:0-9)^^[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_ICC_Men%27s_T20_World_Cup#cite_note-:1-10)^

### Format

The 20 qualifying teams were divided into [four groups of five teams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_ICC_Men%27s_T20_World_Cup#Group_stage); all the five teams in a group played with all the others -- for a total of ten matches -- and the top two teams in each group advanced to the [Super 8 stage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_ICC_Men%27s_T20_World_Cup#Super_8). The advanced 8 teams were divided into two groups of four teams each based on pre-tournament seedings; all the advanced teams in an advanced group played with all the others in that group -- for a total of six matches -- and the top two teams in each advanced group advanced to a four-team semi-final or [knockout stage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_ICC_Men%27s_T20_World_Cup_knockout_stage "2024 ICC Men's T20 World Cup knockout stage").^[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_ICC_Men%27s_T20_World_Cup#cite_note-11)^ Prior to the tournament, the ICC announced the eight [seeded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed_(sports) "Seed (sports)") teams for the Super 8 stage based on [T20I rankings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men%27s_T20I_Team_Rankings "ICC Men's T20I Team Rankings"). On advancing from the group stage, they were placed in pre-determined positions in the Super 8 stage, irrespective of their position in the group stage. If an unseeded team qualified at the expense of a seeded team, it took the position of the corresponding seeded team that failed to qualify from the group.^[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_ICC_Men%27s_T20_World_Cup#cite_note-12)^^[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_ICC_Men%27s_T20_World_Cup#cite_note-13)^

### Schedule

On 28 July 2023, ICC announced that the tournament will be played from 4 to 30 June 2024.^[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_ICC_Men%27s_T20_World_Cup#cite_note-CWC-14)^ The revised schedule was announced on 5 January 2024, with the tournament scheduled to take place from 1 to 29 June.

In addition, each team will receive an additional $31,154 for each match they win excluding the semi-finals and final.^[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_ICC_Men%27s_T20_World_Cup#cite_note-17)^

### Final

[South Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa "South Africa"), after losing the toss, took three early Indian wickets of skipper [Rohit Sharma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma "Rohit Sharma"), [Rishabh Pant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishabh_Pant "Rishabh Pant"), and [Suryakumar Yadav](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suryakumar_Yadav "Suryakumar Yadav"). However, [Virat Kohli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli "Virat Kohli") and [Axar Patel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axar_Patel "Axar Patel") put on a 72-run partnership, with Patel contributing 47 runs. Kohli's 76-run innings and a late contribution of 27 by [Shivam Dube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shivam_Dube "Shivam Dube") helped India reach a total of 176/7, the highest first-innings total in a T20 World Cup final.

South Africa's chase began with the loss of two early wickets, but [Quinton de Kock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinton_de_Kock "Quinton de Kock") and [Tristan Stubbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tristan_Stubbs "Tristan Stubbs") took the total to 106. After they were both dismissed, [Heinrich Klaasen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Klaasen "Heinrich Klaasen") made the fastest fifty in a World Cup final, including scoring 24 runs off the 15th over bowled by Axar Patel. At this point, South Africa required 30 runs in 30 balls with six wickets in hand. However, [Arshdeep Singh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arshdeep_Singh_(cricketer) "Arshdeep Singh (cricketer)"), [Jasprit Bumrah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasprit_Bumrah "Jasprit Bumrah"), and [Hardik Pandya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardik_Pandya "Hardik Pandya") bowled economically in the last 5 overs. Pandya picked up the wicket of Klaasen in the 17th over, Bumrah dismissed [Marco Jansen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Jansen "Marco Jansen") in the 18th over, and Pandya dismissed [David Miller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Miller_(South_African_cricketer) "David Miller (South African cricketer)"), the last recognized batsman, off the first ball of the final over. The tail end batsmen were unable to overhaul India's total, and South Africa ended their innings on 169/8, losing by 7 runs.^[[179]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_ICC_Men%27s_T20_World_Cup#cite_note-188)^

This victory marked India's first ICC title since the [2013 ICC Champions Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_ICC_Champions_Trophy "2013 ICC Champions Trophy"), their first world cup title since the [2011 ICC Cricket World Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Cricket_World_Cup "2011 Cricket World Cup"), and their second [T20 World Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T20_World_Cup "T20 World Cup") crown (the first being the [2007](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_ICC_World_Twenty20 "2007 ICC World Twenty20") title). Kohli's knock earned him the [Player of the Match](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_of_the_Match "Player of the Match") award, while [Jasprit Bumrah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasprit_Bumrah "Jasprit Bumrah") received the Player of the Tournament award.^[[180]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_ICC_Men%27s_T20_World_Cup#cite_note-189)^ [Kohli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli "Virat Kohli"), [Sharma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma "Rohit Sharma") and [Jadeja](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravindra_Jadeja "Ravindra Jadeja") announced their retirement from [T20 international](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20_International "Twenty20 International") format after the final.^[[181]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_ICC_Men%27s_T20_World_Cup#cite_note-190)^ The end of the tournament also marked the end of [Rahul Dravid's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Dravid "Rahul Dravid") tenure as the coach of the Indian cricket team.
